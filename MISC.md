	- Net install.
	- Media Install (CD-ROM/DVD/USB).
- Should have a vairety of install "presets"?:
	- Minimal
	- Custom
	- Automated
	- Basic
	- "Server"?
- Should have a framework for automated/unattended installs.
	- This framework if it can be helped should be:
		- Pre existing.
		- Stupidly simple to write (looking at you Debian preseed).
		- Should be generated for each isntall a person does.
	- e.g. anaconda/kickstart, Debian preeseed.
- Repos should have:
	- The repo server(s) should:
		- Be easy to navigate
		- Have a sensible setup
		- support a variety of protcols http(s)/rsync/ftp(s)
- Packages should:
	- conform to a standardize compression method:
